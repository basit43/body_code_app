  Step 1: 

Ask: Is this disconnection affecting your spirit heart? 

● If yes, move to Step 2.
● If no, ask: Is it affecting your whole spirit body? 
○ If yes, move to Step 2.
○ If no, use the Circuit or System>System section to identify the affected body system and/or body part(s).
■ Then move to Step 2. 
Step 2: 

Ask: Is it necessary to identify more about this disconnection?

● If no, move to Step 3 if desired, or to Association. 
● If yes, you may need to identify one or more of the following: 
○ The age of occurence
■ Use a process of elimination to find the age. For example: 
■ Divide the subject’s age roughly in half, and muscle test to determine if this occurred during the first or second half of life. 
■ Continue dividing and muscle testing in this fashion until you’ve determined the age when the disconnection occurred.
○ Any associated life event
● Knowing when it happened may be useful.
○ When you do not need to know more, move to Step 3 if desired, or to Association. 
Step 3 (optional):  

Use a process of elimination to find the percentage of connection (or skip to Association if desired). 

● Ask: Is there 50% connection? 
○ If yes, continue up from there, finding if it is more or less than 75%. Continue dividing and muscle testing in this fashion until you’ve determined the exact percentage. 
○ If no, continue down from there, finding if it is more or less than 25%. Continue dividing and muscle testing in this fashion until you’ve determined the exact percentage.
