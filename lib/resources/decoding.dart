Step 2: 

Ask: Is it in an Odd Row?

● If yes, it is in an Odd Row (1, 3, or 5).
● If no, it is in an Even Row (2, 4 or 6).
○ Move to Step 3 when you have your answer.
Step 3:

For Odd, ask: Is it in Row 1? (Name odd rows one by one).

For Even, ask: Is it in Row 2? (Name even rows one by one).

● Move to Step 4 when you have your answer.
Step 4: 

Ask: Is it ______? 

● Test each emotion in that box, one by one, until one tests strong. Note the emotion, then repeat for the second (and third, if necessary) frequency.
● When you do not need to know more, move to Association. 
Step 5:

Ask: Is it necessary to identify more about this shared emotional compound?

● If no, move to Association.
● If yes, you may need to identify one or more of the following: 
○ The emotions that make up this compound
■ If this is needed, use the chart of emotions to identify the two or three emotional frequencies. Step by step directions are below.
○ The age of occurence
■ Use a process of elimination to find the age.
■ Divide the subject’s age roughly in half, and muscle test to determine if the emotional compound became trapped during the first or second half of life.
■ Continue dividing and muscle testing in this fashion until you’ve determined the age when the emotional compound became trapped.
○ The event that produced this emotional compound.
■ Knowing when it happened may be useful.
○ Another person that shares this energy (rare).
○ An approximate number of people who it is shared with (rare).
