There are three options for removing an entity. 
■ TThe first option is to simply swipe three times with a magnet or your hand on any length of the governing meridian holding the intention to release the entity.
■ TThe second option is to acknowledge the presence of the entity, and focus the vibrations of compassion and love toward the entity, and swipe three times with a magnet or your hand on any length of the governing meridian to release the entity, intending to send it to the light. 
■ The third option is to swipe three times with a magnet or your hand on any length of the governing meridian while saying words to this effect: "Entity (or Entities, if plural)-in the name of Jesus Christ, (or the Creator, Higher Power, etc) I command you to depart from this person and never bother him / her again." 
● Note:
○ It's a good idea to check for the presence of curses or saboteurs after releasing entities.
○ On rare occasions, fasting and prayer may be required to get entities to leave.
■ TIn order to lessen the likelihood of a future entity imbalance, you may want to do some targeted Body Code work focused on raising the vibration and creating wholeness and balance in the energy body and energy field/aura. In addition, it is suggested to avoid anything that interferes with your personal power or the health of your physical and energetic body.
