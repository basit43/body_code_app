  ● Normally this type of energy is processed and released automatically, but it could become stuck if it is very extreme, or if the body is already imbalanced in some way.
  ■ This type of energy could come from trauma such as: 
  ● Injury like a fall, hit or car accident
  ● Illness (usually extreme)
  ● Surgery

  static const String recoveryTraumaExp =
      '''This is a type of energy that develops when the body’s recovery process (from minor to severe injury or illness) is interrupted, and the body is unable to return to a balanced state.
      ■ Having a recovery interference energy could potentially interfere with normal body processes, and could create frustrating symptoms including:
      ● Chronic or recurring inflammation
      ● Scar tissue
      ● Muscle spasms
      ■ It is important to note that releasing recovery interference energy may potentially encourage the body to initiate a healing process all over again. One result of this could include inflammation, which is generally a normal and important process, as long as it is short-term and is not interrupted.''';
  static const String physicalEmotionalExp =
      '''Physical-emotional shock energy is a vibrational frequency that may become stuck in the body during an emotionally shocking event that is severe enough to exert a shock or extreme stress on the physical body. 
■ Normally this type of energy is processed and released automatically, but it could become stuck if it is very extreme or if the body is already imbalanced in some way.
''';

  static const String physicalIntoleranceExp =
      '''Physical intolerances may manifest if the body comes in contact with a substance that it has trouble processing, usually because the body is already imbalanced or stressed, and is therefore less able to digest or otherwise process the substance. 
■ It is possible to have an intolerance to anything at all, but most commonly, intolerances are from foods and drinks, as well as cosmetics such as lotions and perfumes.
■ The subconscious mind manifests the symptoms of physical intolerance as a way to communicate that the body is imbalanced and is in need of help.
■ Symptoms may include fatigue, extreme or sudden sleepiness, headaches, skin issues, digestive discomfort and bloating.
''';
  static const String idealAllergyExp =
      '''Idea allergies are generally created when the subconscious mind makes a faulty or negative connection with a particular idea (any thought, emotion, concept, event, action, person, place or thing). This usually happens during either prolonged or sudden emotional and/or physical stress. This idea then is considered to be a problem by the subconscious, and a negative response or reaction of some kind will occur when this idea is encountered or could be encountered in the future.
■ The subconscious mind may create an idea allergy as a protective measure, in order to defend you from the stress that it has connected with the idea, and to prevent the stressful past from being repeated. For this reason, you can become allergic to anything at all. 
■ Symptoms may range from subtle to extreme: self-sabotage, emotional reactivity, avoidance, phobias, and even stress-related physical symptoms. The subconscious mind may generate any kind of symptom in an attempt to avoid proximity to this idea.
■ Idea allergies nearly always have associated imbalances such as trapped emotions that must be cleared in order to reset and neutralize the subconscious mind’s response to the idea.
■ It is common to have a physical allergy to any kind of substance associated with the idea allergy. (e.g. if you have an idea allergy to your marriage, you may develop a physical allergy to your partner’s perfume).

  static const String ideaIntoleranceExp =
      '''Idea intolerances may manifest if you come in contact with an idea (any thought, emotion, concept, event, action, person, place or thing) that you have trouble processing or being around, because you are already imbalanced or stressed in some way.
■ It is possible to have an intolerance to any idea at all. 
■ The subconscious mind manifests the symptoms of Idea Intolerance as a way to communicate that you are imbalanced and need help.
■ Symptoms may include fatigue, extreme or sudden sleepiness, headaches, inability to focus, anxiousness, feeling overwhelmed, and other symptoms of stress.

  static const String physicalAllergyExp =
      '''Physical allergies are generally created when the subconscious mind makes a faulty connection with a particular substance during either prolonged or sudden emotional and/or physical stress. This substance then is considered to be an allergen by the subconscious and the body, and a negative response or reaction will occur when this allergen is encountered in the future.
■ The subconscious mind may create a physical allergy as a protective measure, in order to defend you from the stress that it has connected with the allergen. For this reason, you can become allergic to anything at all. 
■ Symptoms may include physical reactions of all kinds as well as immune reactions such as inflammation, respiratory problems, congestion, sinus irritation, itchy eyes, and other forms of hypersensitivity. 
■ Physical allergies nearly always have associated imbalances such as trapped emotions that must be cleared in order to reset the subconscious response to the allergen.
■ It is common to have both a physical allergy and an idea allergy to the same allergen.

  static const String curseExp =
      '''A curse is a strong negative energy that either comes from an entity, from another person, or from your own subconscious mind. Curses are generally intended to block, sabotage or interfere with the recipient’s life, healing, connection to the Divine or actions in some way. 
■ A curse is similar to any other emotional energy, such as a trapped emotion, in that it consists of energy lodged within the energy field of the body.
■ Curses may be created by the subconscious mind and could simply be the expression of negative feelings toward the recipient. 
■ Curses may also be deliberate, consciously created with an intention to achieve a certain (often nefarious) purpose. 
■ When decoding, you may or may not need to identify more about the curse and what its intention was. If you do need to decode the intention, consider the goal you are working toward in your session— that may provide a helpful clue in decoding, in addition to the prompts below. 
''';
  static const String cordingExp =
      '''■ Cords are inherently negative, direct connections between two people. 
■ Cords can cause people to become irritated with each other, to create codependency in the relationship, and/or to be overwhelmingly vulnerable to the negative energy of one another. 
■ A cord is a lower vibrational type of connection, and even cords that are created with good intentions (this is almost always subconscious) can become harmful. All cords should be removed, and instead, you can set the intention to facilitate a balanced and pure exchange of energy with others. 
■ Cords can attach anywhere on the body, but common locations are:
● The gut/navel
● The heart
● The brain
● The neck or back of the neck
● The genitals
■ The location may have interesting metaphysical significance, but is often not necessary to identify when decoding.
■ Some cords can have an open end, especially where the relationship with the other party was abruptly ended for some reason. This may create a vacuum, and the other end of the cord will likely attach to someone new who has a similar vibration to the original person.
■ When removing a cord, it may be helpful to focus on positive feelings for the other person, and remove other imbalances in an attempt to heal that relationship, whether it is current or in the past.
''';
  static const String entityExp =
      '''An entity is a type of spirit/energy being that can affect the physical body, the energy body or the energy field/aura, potentially causing various problems.
■ There is likely a large range of entities, from the mildly irritating to more intensely negative and more capable of causing greater interference with health and balance.
■ There is no reason to fear entities any more than any other imbalance.
■ Follow the Intention procedure and you should always find success with removing any entity you find. 
■ Our experience indicates that entities have contributed to: 
● Fatigue
● Physical discomfort
● Negativity and mood issues
● Addiction
● Feeling like something is there that doesn’t belong
● Feeling stuck
● Feeling conflict or resistance coming from outside
● Self sabotage
● Anger at self
● Self doubt
● Mental illness symptoms
● Nightmares
''';
  static const String postHypnoticExp =
      '''A post-hypnotic suggestion is a specific type of negative vibrational frequency, in the form of a statement, stuck in the subconscious mind. 
■ Post-hypnotic suggestions always come from outside sources and are not of your own creation. However, you may be vulnerable to specific vibrations depending on any associated imbalances that are also present. 
■ You can become vulnerable to post-hypnotic suggestions when exposed to specific types of repetitive music or other vibrations that desynchronize the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. This opens the subconscious mind to “suggestion,” much like being hypnotized. 
■ It is also possible that post-hypnotic suggestions may be trapped while sleeping, therefore, it is highly recommended to play only high vibrational music while sleeping. 
■ A post-hypnotic suggestion may come from an entity, a very negative person, or negative vibrations embedded in whatever music, video games, or other entertainment you were exposed to during the brain desynchronization period.
■ Post-hypnotic suggestions can potentially create troubling symptoms, such as: 
● Mood issues
● Dark thoughts 
● Self-harm 
● Addiction
● Anger at self
● Depression related feelings
■ Use the chart of Despair Anchors and Post-Hypnotic Suggestions to determine what the message is, or close to it. The chart is not exhaustive, and the actual vibration may be a little different. 
■ Use intuition and common sense when decoding. Keep in mind that this is an interpretation process—you may interpret the vibration a little differently than was originally stated. The key is getting close enough when decoding.

  static const String saboteurExp =
      '''A saboteur is a strong negative energy usually from another person, intended to wound and/or sabotage the recipient. 
■ Saboteurs can be compared to invisible but damaging weapons, wounds, or control mechanisms. 
■ Most saboteurs are created by the subconscious mind and are the expression of negative feelings toward the recipient. 
■ Some saboteurs can be self-inflicted, usually if there is ongoing or intense self-abuse. 
■ Saboteurs may cause physical discomfort and interfere with the recovery process. 
■ It is often not necessary to decode very much information, however, the type of weapon and the location in the body may have a metaphysical significance that could be interesting or helpful to think about (e.g. a “knife” in the back may signify a betrayal).

  static const String prenatalTrappedEmotionsExp =
      '''Prenatal trapped emotions usually occur during the third trimester, and are often absorbed emotions from the mother, but can also originate with the fetus.
■ Negative emotions are vibrational frequencies that are generated by the organs and glands in response to stress, an experience, a negative thought, or imbalance in the body.
■ Negative emotions are generally influenced by what is happening in the moment, often in addition to trapped emotions and other imbalances already present.
■ An emotion can become trapped if it is overwhelming in some way, or if the normal emotional process (creating, experiencing, and letting go) gets interrupted somehow.
■ A trapped emotion is a ball of vibrating energy about the size of your clenched fist.
■ Trapped emotions can lodge anywhere in your body, where they can exert a distorting force on the energy field, which can lead to all kinds of physical and emotional issues.

  static const String sharedTrappedEmotionsExp =
      '''Shared emotions are created when people experience an emotionally intense event and together, develop the same vibrational frequency. 
■ These energies are very specific, and must meet the following three criteria:
● The people are experiencing the same exact event.
● The people respond emotionally in the exact same way (the exact same frequency of emotion is created).
● The event/stimulus is experienced at the exact same moment.
■ Shared emotions can be any emotion, but most are innately more painful or extreme, such as fear, grief, or shame.
■ A shared emotion needs only to be released from one person in order to release it from everyone else, since it is the same vibrational frequency.

  static const String inheritedTrappedEmotionsExp =
      '''In the same way that you can inherit your eye color from your father, or the shape of your nose from your mother, you can also inherit trapped emotions from your biological parents, received at the moment of conception. 
■ Some inherited energies may go back many generations. Some may have colored your personality in an undesirable way, or may have caused you to have significant emotional and physical issues.  
■ An emotion is more likely to be passed from a parent to a child if the original emotional experience was significant and powerful.
■ A trapped emotion is a ball of vibrating energy about the size of your clenched fist.

  static const String parentalEmotionalCompound = '''
  A prenatal emotional compound is a type of trapped energy that is similar to a prenatal trapped emotion, but instead of one pure emotional frequency, there are two, or occasionally three (1% of the time) that are blended together. 

● This may be compared to green paint that was made by mixing blue and yellow paint, and that is now a unique shade of green. An emotional compound is one unique energy made from two different emotional energies. The emotions cannot be released separately from one another, although they can usually be individually identified (but not always). 
● An emotional compound forms when two emotions are experienced during the same moment in time, and become trapped together as one ball of energy.
